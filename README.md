## üìã Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Code Quality: Modular, readable, and well-commented code structure

### 2. Responsiveness: Optimized for mobile-first design and scales on all devices

### 3. Accessibility: Meets WCAG AA compliance

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<button>`, and `<form>` for better screen reader support.  
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.  
- **High Contrast Design**: Text and UI elements meet WCAG's contrast ratio requirements (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text).  
- **ARIA Support**: ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-live`, `aria-describedby`) enhance assistive technology compatibility.  
- **Focus Management**: Ensures correct focus handling for smooth navigation, even in dynamic content updates.  
- **Error Messaging**: Clear, accessible error validation using `aria-describedby` for form inputs.
